/**
This function gets the blob information of all the blobs that NXTCam is tracking.
There could be upto 8 blobs being tracked by NXTCam.
All the parameters of this function are return values.
This function will return color and coordinate information for all the blobs.
  @param nblobs      In this variable, number of blobs NXTCam sees are returned.
The blobs NXTCam sees could be of different color or same color.
For e.g. if you have 3 colors defined, say red (color 1), blue (color 2) and green (color3), and you have 3 red objects and 2 blue objects and 1 green object in front of NXTCam, nblobs will be 6.
color[]: a array of colors for the blobs
in above example, Color array will have 6 valid elements - three bytes will say 1 (for color1), and 2 bytes will say (for color 2), and 1 byte will say 3 (for color 3).
Based on sorting chosen, they will be sorted by size or color (if the sorting was color, first 3 bytes will be 1, next two will be 2 and next one will be 3).
  @param color      a array of colors for the blobs (array has 8 elements)
  @param left       the coordinate values of the blobs (array of 8 elements)
  @param top        the coordinate values of the blobs (array of 8 elements)
  @param right      the coordinate values of the blobs (array of 8 elements)
  @param bottom     the coordinate values of the blobs (array of 8 elements)
@return look at the nblobs first to see how many blobs are being tracked, and then read the respective color and coordinate infromation.
