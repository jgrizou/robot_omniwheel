# Omniwheel Robot

An omniwheel robot built with lego, arduino and ROS.

I am using Lego for the structure, motors, and few sensors. An [Arduino mega](http://jgrizou.com/projects/omniwheel-robot/ArduinoBoardMega2560) board controls the motors and sensors using a special [NXshield](http://www.generationrobots.com/en/401132-nxshield-m-for-arduino-mega-or-adk-mindsensors.html). The robot was then controlled using a computer via ROS ([ROS package for Arduino](http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials)). Communication was going through [Xbee](https://www.sparkfun.com/pages/xbee_guide). I further added an [IMU](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10736).
